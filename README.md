## Delay Plugin
This repository houses a delay plugin programmed in JUCE. 

This is the first installment in a series of personal projects wherein I experiment with real-time audio programming and digital signal processing through the creation of plugins. 
This plugin (and all future plugins) will be developed on MacOS (Apple Silicon) and will be deployed as VST, AU, AUv3 and Standalones. 

I envision this series of projects as something that helps me hone my DSP and audio programming skills, in addition to enhancing my knowledge and intuition about how DSP techniques can be used to create exciting audio effects. Eventually, I also want to create a standalone synthesizer that incorporates
the knowledge I acquire through this endeavour in audio programming.
